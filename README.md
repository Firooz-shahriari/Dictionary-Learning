This repository includes the code necessary to replicate our results presented in the paper titled <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9287479">"New Dictionary Learning Methods for Two-Dimensional Signals."</a> 

Should you encounter any errors related to 'ompmex', I recommend referring to the original <a href="https://csaws.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html">code developed by Dr. Rubinstein</a>.
